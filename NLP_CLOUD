In this project, I explored NLP Cloud to understand how Large Language Models (LLMs) and APIs work in real-world applications.
I implemented a console-based Login & Register system (without using any GUI) to strengthen my understanding of backend logic, API handling, and authentication flow.

This project focuses on:

Learning how LLM-powered services can be integrated using APIs

Understanding model selection and usage in NLP Cloud

Building a menu-driven authentication system using Python

Applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in a real project


🧠 Project 1: NLP-Based Login & Register System (Without GUI)

Built a command-line interface (CLI) based application

Implemented Register & Login functionality using Python classes

Used NLP Cloud APIs to explore NLP features and LLM behavior

Focused on logic building instead of UI, to strengthen core concepts

Gained hands-on experience with API keys, requests, and responses
